# scheduler

## Description

The purpose of this project was to practice using Jquery with Bootstrap, and to create a functional daily scheduler that provides an indication of when events have or have not yet occurred. This scheduler allows the user to right down events and those events are saved in local storage for the viewer to see at anytime. Part of the motivation to create this application was to helps solve the problem of daily planning, and to help users who are especially busy through out the day.

This webpage displays a timeblock scheduler for users to write down daily events. The current date is displayed at the top of the page. The time blocks are color coded and indicate whether or not an event has occurred, is in progress, or has not yet occurred. The user can write any notes they wish into the text box of each time block and save the text to the scheduler. The saved text should remain even if the user closes the browser or refreshes it.
